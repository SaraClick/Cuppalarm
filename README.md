## 🍵 Cuppalarm
### The problem
My chronic forgetfulness when it comes to making tea at home. Here's how the current process typically goes down:
- 😋 Feeling parched... a cup of tea sounds perfect. 
- 🔥 I fire up the kettle to get some water boiling.
- 🍵 I plop a tea bag into my mug, pour in the hot water, and let it steep.
- 🕟... and it steeps indefinitely as I wander off, engrossed in something else, only to return to a cold, over-brewed mess. Rinse and repeat.

### The goal
This nifty project is meant to keep an eye on my kitchen counter, detecting when a mug is present and full. It'll then send out an alert after a couple of minutes, reminding me to remove the mug before disaster strikes.

## 🚧 Project in progress 🚧
This is a project in process, when fully finish the README will be accordingly updated.

### 👀 Do you want a sneak peek into my progress so far?
I will be posting about my progress with this project on [ClickToSwitch](https://www.instagram.com/clicktoswitch/). 

Heads up here, social media is not my forte, so it is very possible that I will go silent posting about stuff but if you see the repo still active, you know I am still working on it 😃!
